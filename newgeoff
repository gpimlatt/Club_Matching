Here at ACA Western, we are home to three groups, all with a different purpose but also serving as an opportunity for students to express their love for a capella. The A Cappella Project (TAP) is our non-competitive, co-ed a cappella group. It serves as an open forum for those interested in singing, arranging, and beatboxing. TAP accepts members regardless of experience and hopes to improve members' vocal techniques and performance skills. We are also home to two competitive and auditioned groups, Equivox and Repercussions. Established in 2017, Equivox is our competitive, co-ed a cappella group. They have performed at the ICCA (International Collegiate Championships of A Cappella) quarterfinals three times and the Queen's University Annual A Cappella competition.Established in 2019, Repercussions is compiled of all upper-voices and has performed at the ICCA quarterfinals twice and the Queen's University Annual A Cappella Competition.While our competitive groups often serve a more significant time commitment and have previous music experience, no experience is required to audition.Regardless of your vocal/music experience, if you have a passion for singing, you love to perform, and you are looking for a second family at university, there is a place for you at ACA Western!"

We explore many faith-related topics at our meetings, including salvation, sin, the Trinity, Mary, the Eucharist, and other Sacraments, the lives of the Saints, etc. We also discuss controversial 'hot topics' such as homosexuality, contraception, and abortion, in the hopes that we can both understand our faith and be able to share it with others with greater clarity. We regularly engage in prayer through lectio divina (prayerful reading of the Scriptures), praise and worship, and other forms of prayer. We have fun activities such as laser tag, movie nights and games nights, men's and women's nights, and lots of parties with food. We also volunteer to give back to the London community, at locations such as St. Joseph's Hospitality Centre and the London Food Bank.

    "Short description": "MusicBox Children’s Charity - Western Chapter is a student club affiliated with MusicBox Children’s Charity. We aim to bring music education to vulnerable children in the London area. An education in music is incredibly beneficial for young children—we know that it helps develop interpersonal skills, goal-setting skills, motivation, and resiliency and it provides them with a hobby that they can enjoy. We believe that vulnerable children should be granted the same opportunities for growth and development that a music education provides that are available to their peers. We run one-on-one instrument lessons for school-aged children and group music activities for younger children at our community partner."
